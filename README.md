# Phishing Website
---

This website is a replica of UTKs print center (https://myprint.utk.edu/myprintcenter/). It was created in order to phish for user NetID's and passwords.

`To run: node server.js`

The site will store the user's NetID and password into a JSON file and then redirect the user to the real website.

The certificate and private key are currently stored locally.
