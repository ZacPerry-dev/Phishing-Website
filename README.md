# Phishing Website
---

This website is a replica of UTKs print center (https://myprint.utk.edu/myprintcenter/). It was created in order to phish for user NetID's and passwords. The site will store the user's NetID and password into a JSON file and then redirect the user to the real website when attempting to login.

Ensure you have node installed -> `To run: node server.js`

The certificate and private key are both currently stored locally.
